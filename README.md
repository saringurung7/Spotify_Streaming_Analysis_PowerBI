 - Data Walkthrough & Exploration – Reviewed dataset structure and attributes.

 - Data Connection – Connected and imported Spotify data into Power BI.

 - Data Cleaning & Quality Check – Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

 - Data Modeling – Established relationships and designed a fact-dimension model.

 - Data Processing & Transformation – Applied necessary transformations for structured analysis.

 - DAX Calculations – Created custom measures and calculated columns for key metrics and insights.

 - Dashboard Layout & Design – Structured the report for intuitive navigation.

 - Charts Development & Formatting – Built interactive visuals with proper formatting.

 - Dashboard Development & Interactivity – Implemented drill-through, drill-down, and hierarchy navigation.

 - Insights Generation & Analysis – Identified key trends in music streaming behavior.


# Key Insights & Analysis

1️⃣ Overall Listening Trends (Yearly Analysis)

 - There’s a decline in listening engagement over the years:

   - Albums played in 2024 decreased by 20.19% compared to 2023.

   - Artists played dropped by 24.43%, indicating a shift towards repetitive listening.

   - Tracks played remained stable, meaning users are playing the same tracks more frequently rather than discovering new music.

 - The Beatles dominate the most played artist and album lists.

 - Most played track: "Ode To The Mets", followed by "In The Blood" and "Dying Breed".

2️⃣ Listening Behavior: Time & Frequency Patterns

 - Peak listening hours:

   - Late nights (12 AM - 6 AM) and evenings (6 PM - 11 PM) show the highest engagement.

   - Daytime hours (9 AM - 5 PM) see the least activity, suggesting work/school-related decline in streaming.

 - Track Frequency vs Listening Duration:

   - Most tracks are played for less than 5 minutes, indicating short engagement per song.

   - A few tracks have high repeat counts, but users tend to shuffle between different songs.

3️⃣ Album & Track-Level Analysis

 - Total Stats:

    - 7,907 Albums, 4,112 Artists, and 13,665 Tracks in total.

    - Total listening time = 1.92 billion milliseconds (~533 hours or ~22 days of continuous music).

    - Average listening time per track: 2.14 minutes, which suggests frequent song skipping.

 - Listening Style:

    - Many albums contain only 1-2 tracks, meaning users prefer fragmented listening (playlists or singles) rather than full album sessions.

    - Some albums (e.g., "The Opera Gala") have longer play durations (~5 minutes per track).

# Actionable Takeaways:

✅ Listening behavior is shifting towards shorter and more repetitive sessions.

✅ Users engage more during evenings and weekends, making them prime hours for playlist creation or recommendations.

✅ The Beatles remain a dominant artist, suggesting nostalgic or classic music preference.

✅ Users are engaging with playlists or selective tracks rather than full albums.
